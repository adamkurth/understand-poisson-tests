    "------------------------------------\n",
    "- The Poisson distribution is a discrete probability distribution that expresses the probability of a given number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space. Usually associated with rare events, and is perhaps the second most used after the binomial distribution.\n",
    "- Rare events over time, and over surface area are common applicaitons of the Poisson distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumptions 4.1:\n",
    "1. the prob. of observing 1 death is directly proportional to the length of time in the interval $\\Delta t$. i.e. $P(1 death) \\approx \\lambda \\Delta t$ for some constant $\\lambda$.\n",
    "2. the prob. of observing 0 deaths over $\\Delta t$  is approximately $1-\\lambda \\Delta t$. \n",
    "3. The prob. of ovserving more than 1 death over this time interval is essentially 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumptions 4.2:  \n",
    "**Stationary**: Assume the number of deaths per unit time is the same throughout the entire interval. Thus an increase in the indicent of the disease as time goes on within the time period $t$ would violate this assumption. Notice that $t$ should not be overly long because this assumption is less likely to hold as $t$ increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumption 4.3:\n",
    "**Independence**: If a number of deaths occur within one time subinterval, then it has no bearing on the probability of death in the next time subinterval. Would be violated in epidemic situations if a new case of the disease occurs, then subsequent dealths are likely to build up over a short period of time until after the epidemic subsides.\n",
