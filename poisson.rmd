### Poisson 

```{r cars}
lambda1 <- 5
lambda2 <- 7
n1 <- 50
n2 <- 50

# generate data
x1 <- rpois(n1, lambda1)
x2 <- rpois(n2, lambda2)

# means
mean1 <- mean(x1)
mean2 <- mean(x2)

# set significance level
alpha <- 0.05

cat("Sample 1: mean = ", mean1, "n1 = ", n1, "\n")
cat("Sample 2: mean = ", mean2, "n2 = ", n2, "\n")
```

### Large Sample Z ~ N(0,1)


```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
pooled <- (sum(x1) + sum(x2)) / (n1 + n2)

# z stat
z_stat <- (mean1 - mean2) / sqrt(pooled_lambda * (1/n1 + 1/n2))

# p-value
z_pval <- 2 * (1 - pnorm(abs(z_stat))) # two-tailed test
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
