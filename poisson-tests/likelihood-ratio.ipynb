    "The usual setting to learn Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT)/LR statistic is evaluting under the simple null hypothesis. Suppose that the parameter $\\theta_0$ is the value of the parameter under the null hypothesis, and $\\hat{\\theta}$ is the MLE estimate of the parameter in question. The likelihood ratio test is a statistical test which measures the ratio of the two likelihood functions. \n",

    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Visually, this ratio can be understood as the proportion of the heights of the two likelihood functions evaluated at each $\\theta_0, \\hat{\\theta}$, where the likelihood function is the probability of the observed data given the parameter. \n",

The value of $c$ is chosen such that the Type I error rate is controlled at a certain level, usually $\\alpha = 0.05$. This test statistic is a measure of how much more likely the data are under the alternative hypothesis than under the null hypothesis.\n",
